How to Use:

Download Dataset by Sully Chen: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-KJCaaF7elleG1RbzVPZWV4Tlk/view] Size: 25 minutes = 25{min} x 60{1 min = 60 sec} x 30{fps} = 45,000 images ~ 2.3 GB

Note: You can run without training using the pretrained model if short of compute resources

<b>Use python3 Predict_model_v2.py to run the model on the dataset</b>
